Lov is not just an emotion fenced by trust loyalty commitment.Lov is 2 b hollowed out,unravel every bond&promise.Read every prayer backwards 
How sweet is this. Thank you both aVYx2mAg 
Sum films u never want to end. Making Fan has been that emotion. It’s sad that all good things have to end too…like Life Love & Lhter. 
I come to u,forgetting the world,a prayer awakens in my heart,colour me ochre:the colour of dawn,for I begin from u & extinguish within you 
U two were even then more keen to b in front of the camera rather than behind it. Such wannabe actors u both are!! e4LglJdYUi 
Where I meet u,away from the sun,slipping thru the shade,a moment pauses,the sky melts into a mirror & sets within it:forming ur face.#Gerua 
I like VnKDqI8B 
Gerua means Ochre or Orange to keep it simple…even a bit saffrony. So colour me in the colour of love. 9N0HTH4niz 
Also Arijit for lending me his beautiful voice and Farah Khan and Akki for the styling. Gerua makes me feel beautiful and in love. 
Kajol, Apni shakal mat dikhana…nahi toh ek aur sundar sa gaana gaa doonga. Thx Sony Pritam & Amitabh. Gerua time!gt7Np4kWAr
