I love how Trump supporters openly disregard all of the comments Trump has made. He LITERALLY talked about grabbing women's pussy. Jan 25, 2017
I know i'm on a politirant: The Women's March isn't done because of our sensitivity, we elected someone who publically objectified women. Jan 25, 2017

Documentaries are really underrated too. They're real life, personal experiences. Basically a movie, but real! Everything! Apr 24, 2015
I want to make a documentary, like a low budget one, just to inform people about certain issues. Like child abuse and mental illness. Apr 24, 2015

It angers me when people don't understand the importance of preventing child abuse. It's a bigger problem than others make it out to be. Apr 14, 2015
@natandalex Alex you're the mega bae Apr 13, 2015
@natandalex @MTV "Look at us we're ninjas" Ahh my favorite part ‚ù§Ô∏è Apr 13, 2015

@NaughtyBoyMusic It's so stupid how much hate you're getting. Your song with Zayn is amazing!! Apr 01, 2015
It makes me so upset seeing how people are reacting to Zayn. No offense, but some people are REALLY hypocritical. Be educated please Apr 01, 2015

Its weird seeing people not being upset about Zayn, as well as be comical about it. Idk its just idk Mar 25, 2015
@HarryPrairie They make up my life. They're that presence that is always there, never faltering. Now it's still there, but with a change Mar 25, 2015
@michaelsimeon Its always hard to accept, because once you start to love things, you never realize that it won't be there forever. Mar 25, 2015
@James_Yammouni People are cutting themselves too! Nobody should self harm Mar 25, 2015
@HarryPrairie Its true, I know it makes him happier but damn, its depressing Mar 25, 2015
Guys, please don't cut yourselves for Zayn. Self harm is never the answer to anything, think about yourself, time passes and please no. Mar 25, 2015
YOU WENT THROUGH XFACTOR WITH THEM LIKE ITS NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR US IM SO SORRY BUT ITS TRUE Mar 25, 2015
